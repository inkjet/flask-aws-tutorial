### Deploying a Flask application in AWS: An end-to-end tutorial

This is the code that goes along with the detailed writeup here:

It's a simple Flask app that writes and reads from a database. It uses Amazon RDS for the database backend, but you can make things even simpler and use a local DB.

To tool around with the app directly, here's a quickstart guide. 

Clone this repo to your local machine. In the top level directory, create a virtual environment:
```
$ virtualenv flask-aws
$ source flask-aws/bin/activate
```
Now install the required modules:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To play with the app right away, you can use a local database. Edit ```config.py``` by commenting out the AWS URL and uncomment this line:
```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///test.db'
```
Next run:
```
$ python db_create.py
```
And the tables are created.  Now you can launch the app:
```
$ python application.py
```
And point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:5000

Using the top form, you can write to the database:

Using the bottom form, you can see the last 1 to 9 entires of the database in reverse chronological order:
